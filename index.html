    <h1><strong>PRERANA PRAKASH<strong></h1>
    <p>As a third-year engineering student at St Joseph Engineering College, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and contribute to the advancement of our society. With a strong foundation in Electronics and Communications, I have developed a diverse skill set and hands-on experience through coursework, projects, and internships.</p>

    <h2>Academic and Technical Proficiencies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Skills:</strong> Proficient in MATLAB, GitHub, VS Code, Keil uVision, Multisim, Cadence.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytical and Problem-Solving Abilities:</strong> Strong analytical skills honed through rigorous coursework and practical applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Projects</h2>
    <h3>Micro Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Smart Walking Stick for the Visually Impaired</li>
        <li>Driver drowsiness detection</li>
        <li>Diabetes Prediction Model</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Mini Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SIGN LANGUAGE TO SPEECH CONVERSION:</strong> Created a Sign Language to Speech translation system using gloves and Arduino Mega, enabling real-time gesture recognition and conversion to audible speech.</li>
        <li><strong>MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE RATIO:</strong> Developed a predictive model for maternal mortality rates using data analysis and machine learning algorithms (SVM, RF, LR, KNN, DT) to identify key factors influencing maternal health outcomes, aiming to improve healthcare strategies and outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Led a team of 5 members to secure Third place in 'The Muller Medithon-2023,' held at Father Muller in Mangalore, with a cash prize of INR 10,000.</li>
        <li>Won First place in ‘INGENIOUS - 2023’, a business planning competition, held at SJEC, Mangalore, with a cash prize of INR 2,000.</li>
        <li>Won First place in ‘Python Bootcamp- 2023’ organized by the Samarthya Club, held at SJEC, with a cash prize of INR 2,000.</li>
        <li>Won Third place in ‘ELECTROVATION’ and earned full sponsorship for the project of ‘Sign Language to Speech Conversion’.</li>
        <li>Secured a place among the TOP 25 teams in ‘EMERGE - 2024’, a startup fest held in Mangalore.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Internships and Work Experience</h2>
    <p><strong>RDL TECHNOLOGIES PVT LTD:</strong> During a four-week internship, gained expertise in various technologies related to Embedded Systems, particularly ESP32, and applied my learning to practical projects, including a medicine reminder system, hand gesture motor control, and face recognition using PictoBox.</p>

    <h2>Leadership and Extracurricular Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vice president- SAMARTHYA CLUB (ongoing)</li>
        <li>Media Coordinator - IEEE (ongoing)</li>
        <li>Committee Member - SigMath Association (2023-2024)</li>
        <li>Committee Member - Innoventure (2022-2023)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting, where I can continue to learn and grow. I am particularly interested in opportunities related to Arduino Projects, Python Fullstack. If you are interested in connecting or have opportunities that align with my skills and interests, please feel free to reach out.</p>
